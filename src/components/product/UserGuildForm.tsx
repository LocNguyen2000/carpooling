      Environmental pollution has become a controversial issue that puts severe
      pressure on our rhythm of life. An yearly environmental report by WHO in
      2018 revealed that 9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels
      of pollutants. Both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution
      are responsible for about 7 million deaths globally per year; in Vietnam,
      around 60 000 deaths each year are air pollution-related [5][9]. “Climate
      change is destroying our path to sustainability. Ours is a world of
      looming challenges and increasingly limited resources. Sustainable
      development offers the best chance to adjust our course.” (Ban Ki-moon -
      Former UN Secretary)
